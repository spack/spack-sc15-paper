\begin{verbatim}
- Why do supercomputing centers need this?

	- specs
		- describe concisely
		- query installed stuff
		- modules require standardized set of names (no order)

	- flexibility (managing combinatoric configuration space)

	- RPATHs instead of (or in addition to) modules
		- pkgs work as built when run
		- spack means there is no module incantation required

	- code teams can build own libs & stacks

	- Contributions:
		1. Flexible mechanism for specifying and querying config space (spec)
		2. Implementation of this in spack
		3. 3 detailed use cases outlining our experiences at LLNL
			a. combinatoric versions
			b. multi-version python installation
			c. site-specific and user-specific policies
